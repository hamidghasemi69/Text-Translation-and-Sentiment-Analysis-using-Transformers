Sentiment Analysis Using Hugging Face Transformers

# Project Overview: Analyze the sentiment of movie reviews
In this project, I analyzed the sentiment of the movies reviews in three different languages i.e. English, French, and Spanish. I went through this projects in three steps:


 - The first step of this project was to read data from all the .csv files and create a single pandas dataframe. 
 - The next step was to convert the French and Spanish reviews and synopses into English. This allowed us to analyze the sentiment of all reviews in the same language. I used pre-trained transformers from HuggingFace to achieve this task.
 - Finally, I used pretrained transformers from HuggingFace to analyze the sentiment of each review. The sentiment analysis results (Positive or Negative) was added to the dataframe in a new column called Sentiment.
