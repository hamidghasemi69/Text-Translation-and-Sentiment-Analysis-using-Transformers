Sentiment Analysis Using Hugging Face Transformers

# Project Overview: Analyze the sentiment of movie reviews
In this project, I analyzed the sentiment of movie reviews in three different languages: English, French, and Spanish. The project was divided into three steps:

1. The first step involved reading data from multiple .csv files and combining them into a single pandas DataFrame.
2. The second step was to translate the French and Spanish reviews and synopses into English. This allowed for sentiment analysis to be conducted on all reviews in the same language. I used pre-trained transformers from HuggingFace for this task.
3. The final step involved using pre-trained transformers from HuggingFace to analyze the sentiment of each review. The sentiment analysis results (Positive or Negative) were added to the DataFrame in a new column called "Sentiment."
